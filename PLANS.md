Plans
=====

- allow for ranges, eg. after using `comments` showing you comments
  11-15, you could use `comments 6-10` to show the previous page

- or keep the current window and have a new command `previous` and
  `next` that go through the list
  
- add a new command `more` to load older posts

- add a new command `aspect` to set the current aspect such that new
  posts only get posted to that aspect
  
- the current aspect should also filter `home`
