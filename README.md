Jan Pona Mute
=============

The name is Toki Pona and means "many friends".

This is a very simple command line client for Diaspora that helps me
deal with my specific use-cases:

- I want to check Diaspora for new comment on my threads
- I want to leave new comments on my threads
- I want to delete comments I left by mistake

It's *very* limited but it's helping me get started using the
[https://github.com/marekjm/diaspy diaspy] Python library.
